# moodle-local_filterurlresbak

This plugin is part of a set of plugins belonging to the socialwall course format (https://github.com/synergylearning/moodle-format_socialwall)

If your course displays in socialwall format you are able to use a filter called "URL resource filter". This is a new filter that will convert a URL resource type http link that is added and will grab the title and a photo similar to how facebook does from the remote website to display it on the course page.

This plugin is needed to store the data generated by the filter (like alternative title for the url and selected photo) in the course backup.
